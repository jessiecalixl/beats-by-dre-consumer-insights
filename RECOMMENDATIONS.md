## Product Improvements
Based on the analysis, the products' technology needs to be improved.

Some consumers complain about the products' noise cancellation, spatial audio, and transparency options. They need technological advancements on these areas. These could be done by investing and experimenting with more innovative technologies.

Additionally, Beats needs to find ways to imrpove their products' battery life. Also regarding battery, consumers ask for wireless charging methods. They mention that for their prices the products should be more innovative.

By analyzing Beats by Dre earbuds, their competitors, reviews and perferred earbud features, I have gained valuable insights that are helpful for Beats to achieve product improvement, brand enhancement, competitive advantage and strategized marketing.

Overall, consumers value highly recognized brands' earbuds. Yet, they request quality and price relationship. They ask that premium brands that have a high price should indicate better technologies and design. They value fit, design, battery life, and noise control features a lot.
